Introduction
---------------
This is a modern and ever growing world. Every second infinite nbumber of things are happening all over the globe and internet plays a vital role in this. 
Major companies or individuals rely on the news for several actions but with the increase rise in fake news it's been a very difficult task to segregate the original
information from the fake one. That is where this project comes in. This project is a simple analysis and representation of the number of fake news being spread on the interet. 

Now let's come to the major question, what exactly is a fake news? 

What is Fake news? 
--------------- 
A fake news is nothing but a hoax spread commonly through social media and other social media platforms. There are various reasons why these hoaxes or fake news are created, they can be created to grab attention, they can be made to socialize any blog or a page, they can be made to oblivate someone's name and various other reasons. So, any piece of information that tends to deviate a user from original news is a fake news. 

Now that we have understood what is Fake news, it's time to look at the dataset and draw essential conclusions from it. 

Dataset
---------
The dataset has 6335 rows/instances and 4 columns/features. The features or columns being: 
1. Unnames: The first column is unnamed but it may represent the index number of the fake news. 
2. Title: This feature represents the title or the headline of the news. 
3. Text: This column represents the textual data or the actual news on which we will build our model. 
4. Label: This is the important feature/column of the dataset as it represents if the news is fake or real. This column has two values, FAKE or REAL which represents if the news is fake or real. (This is also our target feature.)

So, this was all about our dataset, the feature Label and text plays an imortant role in this analysis project.
